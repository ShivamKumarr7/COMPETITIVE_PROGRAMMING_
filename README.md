# COMPETITIVE_PROGRAMMING_

I thought of solving CODEFORCES PROBLEMS DAILY and to keep a track of it,I made this repository.

I will start from the most basic problem i.e Watermelon 4A and will eventually move on to some complex problems.

Also, I am learning new algotihms and data structures on a daily basis.

I might do a few Codechef problems and will add them in this repository.

Thank You!
